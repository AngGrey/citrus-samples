Citrus samples ![Logo][1]
==============

Java config sample
---------

This sample uses pure Java configuration for Citrus. No XML files all pure Java.
  
Server
---------

Got to the folder and start the BookStore WebService application in a Web Container. Easiest
way for you to do this is to execute

> mvn jetty:run

here!

An embedded Jetty Web Server Container is started with the BookStore application deployed. You can
alsp call "mvn package" and deploy the resulting war archive to a separate Web container of your choice.
  
Citrus test
---------

Once the sample application is deployed and running you can execute the Citrus test cases.
Open a separate command line terminal and navigate to the sample folder.

Execute all Citrus tests by calling

> mvn integration-test

You can also pick a single test by calling

> mvn integration-test -Ptest=TestName

You should see Citrus performing several tests with lots of debugging output in both terminals (sample application server
and Citrus test client). And of course green tests at the very end of the build.
